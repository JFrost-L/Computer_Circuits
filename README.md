## What are Computer Circuits?
A **computer circuit** refers to the electrical path or network that carries out specific functions such as computation, data storage, or signal processing. These circuits form the backbone of all digital devices, from simple calculators to advanced computers.

Computer circuits can be classified into:
- **Digital Circuits**: Operate with binary data (0s and 1s) and are used in computers and other digital devices.
- **Analog Circuits**: Deal with continuous signals and are used in applications like sound processing and communication systems.

## Key Components of Computer Circuits

### 1. Transistors
- **Transistors** act as switches or amplifiers in a circuit. In digital circuits, they are used to turn on or off signals, and are the key components of logic gates.
  - **Types**: Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET).

### 2. Resistors
- **Resistors** limit the amount of current flowing through a circuit, ensuring that other components are not damaged by excessive current.

### 3. Capacitors
- **Capacitors** store and release electrical energy. They are used in filtering applications and in managing power supply to different components.

### 4. Diodes
- **Diodes** allow current to flow in one direction only, and are commonly used in circuits to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).

## Types of Computer Circuits

### 1. Combinational Circuits
- **Combinational Circuits** are circuits where the output solely depends on the current input. These circuits do not store any state or memory.
  - **Examples**: Adders, Multiplexers, Decoders.

### 2. Sequential Circuits
- **Sequential Circuits** have outputs that depend on both the current input and previous states (history). They have memory components that store past information.
  - **Examples**: Flip-Flops, Registers, Counters.

### 3. Analog vs Digital Circuits
- **Analog Circuits** work with continuous signals, handling a range of values.
- **Digital Circuits** operate with discrete signals, typically binary (0 or 1), and form the core of all modern digital devices.
